## Updates

The first iteration of the actuator had many flaws. One of these major flaws was that many parts would break as a result of torsional stress. Most notably, the sun gear, and the planet gear carrier. To counter this, the second iteration of the actuator uses chrome gears to replace the PLA sun gears. These chrome gears have 15 teeth and a gear module of 0.8 (https://www.monotaro.com/p/3682/5512/?t.attr_f957=0.8&t.attr_f958=15&t.q=%83M%83A). As some motors do not have a shaft for the gears to attach to, a sun gear adapter was created to counter this issue. As for the planet gear carriers, the part was split into two different models. The Planet Carrier Bottom connects to the Planet Carrier Top with the planet gear in between. These two parts can then be screwed in place with an M4 screw. Overall, the issue main issue with the first iteration was that the actuator broke under high torque.
